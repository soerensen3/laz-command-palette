# LazCommandPalette

LazCommandPalette is an IDE-Extension for Lazarus that resembles the command palette window of the [Atom](https://atom.io/) editor. If you press **Ctrl + Shift + P** a window appears where you can see a list of commands that can be filtered by a search and executed with the **Return** key or canceled with **Escape**.

Internally it works with the commands that can be assigned to the buttons of the toolbar. So if a commmand is not working it is most likely someone else`s fault :smiley:!
